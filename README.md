# Horse Tracker

## Description

This is a simple script that tracks when a horse or list of horses are running and provides a notification when they are running.
The app uses the [Sporting Life](https://www.sportinglife.com/) website to get the information about the horses.

The notifications will contain information such as:

* Meeting, Date and Race Time
* Jockey and Trainer
* Horse Age and Sex
* Form
* Odds
* Commentary (if available)
* Last Ran (if available)

## Configuration

To configure the script, you will need to edit the `config.yaml` file. You simply need to ass your horses to the `horses_to_watch` key.
